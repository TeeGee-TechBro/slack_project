# slack_project
HOW I BUILT MY "SLACK APP".
first step: i did "expo init slack_project" in "Gitbash" to then selected a blank javascript to use.
then i "cd into slack_project", installed 'WebView' using 'Yarn'
i also use the documentation on how to use the "WebView" package in "React Native", also with some youtube videos.
i then configured the "App.js" file, edited the styles, did "expo start" to view my app on "Andriod Emulator",
then ran the "eas build -p android --profile preview" to build a app for andriod device only.
link to the device on "appetize.io" https://appetize.io/app/y3a22rdo3qyfugobmdweutvihu?device=pixel4&osVersion=11.0&scale=75.
insert or click on the above link, it will take you to the app, click on "Tap to Play to view".
Thank for reading and testing out my app.
